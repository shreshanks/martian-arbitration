# Martian Arbitration App Walkthrough

I have successfully scaffolded and implemented the minimal full-stack application for the Martian Arbitration system.

## Changes Made
- **Backend Setup (`backend/`)**
  - Created [package.json](file:///e:/Martian%20abitration/backend/package.json) for the Node/Express backend.
  - Implemented [server.js](file:///e:/Martian%20abitration/backend/server.js) with the `POST /evaluate` endpoint. It accepts the proposal data and returns structured mocked feedback from the MLUA, DAS, and BRA, along with a computed final verdict.
  - Configured `cors` and `express.json()` middleware.

- **Frontend Setup (`frontend/`)**
  - Created a Vite React application structure manually.
  - Implemented [App.jsx](file:///e:/Martian%20abitration/frontend/src/App.jsx) with the required evaluation form.
  - Added simulated staged loading (1 second delay per department review) logic using `setTimeout`.
  - Displayed the final JSON-esque structured output indicating the verdicts and notes from all three departments.
  - Created [index.css](file:///e:/Martian%20abitration/frontend/src/index.css) applying a "sterile government beige base" and "retro-futuristic accent highlights" theme, avoiding heavy external frameworks for maximum performance.

## Status of Verification
During the execution phase, I attempted to initialize the project using `npm` commands, but encountered errors indicating `npm` and `node` are not recognized in your current PowerShell environment. 

As a result, I manually wrote the requisite scaffold files alongside the source code. Because `node` is not immediately accessible in the terminal, I bypassed the automated local execution and verification step.

## How to Run It Locally
When your Node.js environment is configured, run the following commands in separate terminal tabs:

**Tab 1: Backend**
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

**Tab 2: Frontend**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
