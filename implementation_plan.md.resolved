# Goal Description
Create a minimal full-stack web application for the "Martian Arbitration" project. It includes a React frontend using Vite and an Express.js backend. The app simulates an evaluation process for development proposals by three Martian bureaucratic departments with a specific "retro-futuristic sterile government beige" theme.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend Setup
Initialize a Node.js project in `e:/Martian abitration/backend`.
Dependencies: `express`, `cors`.
#### [NEW] [server.js](file:///e:/Martian abitration/backend/server.js)
Create a `POST /evaluate` endpoint that receives the form data and returns mocked JSON results for:
- Martian Land Use Authority
- Department of Atmospheric Stability
- Bureau of Resource Allocation
- Final Decision

### Frontend Setup
Initialize a React project in `e:/Martian abitration/frontend` using Vite.
Dependencies: standard React app.
#### [NEW] [App.jsx](file:///e:/Martian abitration/frontend/src/App.jsx)
Build a form component for Sector, Development Type, Water Usage, Energy Consumption, Population Impact, and Terraforming Impact. Handle the staged 1-second delay for each department before showing the mocked verdict.
#### [NEW] [index.css](file:///e:/Martian abitration/frontend/src/index.css)
Apply CSS styling to match the sterile government beige and retro-futuristic theme. Use custom CSS and avoid heavy frameworks.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Run backend using `node server.js` from `e:/Martian abitration/backend`.
2. Run frontend using `npm run dev` from `e:/Martian abitration/frontend`.
3. Open the local dev server URL in a browser.
4. Fill out the form fields and click "Submit to Interplanetary Bureaucracy".
5. Verify the staged loading sequence (1 second per department) and the final JSON-like output.
